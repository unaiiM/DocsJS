Declaration
---------------
You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
Evenry variable declaration starts with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($) and can follow with numbers or the other ones.
- Identifier --> is a sequence of characters in the code that identifies a variable, function, or property.

- var
- let
- const

Destructuring assignment
------------------
Can declare variables to unpack values from an object.
For example, `const { bar } = foo`. This will create a variable named bar and assign to it the value corresponding to the key of the same name from object foo.
