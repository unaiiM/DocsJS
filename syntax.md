Lexical structure

Charset
--------------------
JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. That means we can use unicode chars to define variables like 端:
const Fr端h = "foobar";
But, the variable fr端h is not the same as Fr端h because JavaScript is case sensitive.

In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;). A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons.

Statement --> is a line of code commanding a task.
