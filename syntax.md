--------------------
Lexical structure
--------------------
Is the set of elementary rules that specifies how you write programs in that language.
--------------------
Case sensitive
--------------------
identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.
```
The while keyword, for example, must be typed “while,” not “While” or “WHILE.” Similarly, online, Online, OnLine, and ONLINE are four distinct variable names.
```
--------------------
Charset
--------------------
JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. That means we can use unicode chars to define variables like ü:
const Früh = "foobar";
But, the variable früh is not the same as Früh because JavaScript is case sensitive.

In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;). A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons.

--------------------
Literals
--------------------
A literal is a data value that appears directly in the code of a program.
```
"abc" --> string literal
123   --> number literal
2.4   --> number literal
5 + 5 --> an expressión, is not a literal, the literals will be the two fives
true  --> boolean literal
```
--------------------
Basic concepts
--------------------
Statement --> is a line of code commanding a task.
